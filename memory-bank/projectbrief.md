# Project Brief: Family Scheduler Mobile App

**Core Goal:** To create a cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile application using React Native that serves as a primary interface for the Family Scheduler platform.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Provide a seamless, user-friendly mobile experience mirroring the web platform's core functionality.
*   Enable on-the-go family coordination (viewing schedules, managing events/tasks, RSVPing, communication).
*   Leverage native features like push notifications.
*   Interact exclusively with the existing Django REST API for all data operations and business logic.
*   Maintain security, performance, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).

**Scope:** Implement features outlined in `react_native_app_spec.md`, including Authentication, Dashboard, Calendar Views, Event Management, Task Management, Notes, Vacation Planning, Family Management, Notifications, and Settings.
