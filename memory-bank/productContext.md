# Product Context: Family Scheduler Mobile App

## Why This Project Exists

The Family Scheduler platform currently has a web interface. This project aims to extend the platform's reach and usability by providing a dedicated mobile application for iOS and Android. The mobile app will allow family members to manage their schedules, tasks, and communication more conveniently while on the go.

## Problems It Solves

*   **Lack of Mobile Access:** Users currently need a web browser to access the platform, which is less convenient on mobile devices.
*   **Delayed Coordination:** Relying on web access can delay responses to event invitations or updates to shared schedules.
*   **Missed Updates:** Without native push notifications, users might miss timely reminders or important changes.

## How It Should Work

The mobile app should:
*   Offer a user-friendly interface optimized for touch interaction on iOS and Android.
*   Mirror the core functionality of the web platform, ensuring consistency.
*   Allow users to view unified calendars, manage events (create, view details, RSVP, search), manage tasks, view/edit notes, plan vacations (including packing/grocery lists), and manage basic family/profile settings.
*   Implement secure authentication (JWT/OAuth) identical to the web platform.
*   Use push notifications for timely alerts (reminders, invites, etc.).
*   Interact solely with the existing Django REST API for all data.
*   Be performant, secure, and accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
*   Potentially integrate with native calendars if deemed necessary and approved by the user.

## User Experience Goals

*   **Seamless:** Intuitive navigation and flow.
*   **Consistent:** Familiar experience for users of the web platform.
*   **Efficient:** Quick access to common tasks and information.
*   **Reliable:** Stable performance and clear error feedback.
*   **Accessible:** Usable by family members with diverse abilities.
